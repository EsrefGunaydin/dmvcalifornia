# Missing Traffic Sign Images

## Still Need to Create:

### 1. Do Not Enter Sign
**Filenames needed:**
- `sign-5.webp` (Traffic Signs & Signals Practice Test, Question 17)
- `sign-22.webp` (Pedestrians & Bicycles Practice Test, Question 5)

**Description:** Red circle with white rectangular bar containing "DO NOT ENTER" text

**Answer:** "You cannot enter the road from your direction" / "Do not enter the road from your direction"

**Note:** Both questions refer to the same "Do Not Enter" sign. You can create one image and copy it to both filenames, or update the quiz to reference the same file.

---

## Summary
- **Total images in folder:** 22 webp files
- **Total images referenced in quizzes:** 25 references
- **Fixed references:** 2 (left-turn filename, stop-sign duplicate)
- **Still missing:** 2 files (both "Do Not Enter" signs)

Once you add the "Do Not Enter" sign images, all traffic signs will be complete!
