If you fail, you can take it and you can work at home, you can read past driving test questions and take sample tests to improve your knowledge. But in the United States, driving on the road is a different story, and especially in California, some traffic practices might be different than in your home country or another state of the US.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>So here are some tips and tricks for you and the top ten mistakes most people do while they are taking DMV California Behind The Wheel Test.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Unsafe Lane Change</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>This is one of the basic reasons why most drivers fail the test.  If you don’t change the lane safely, the examiner for sure will not let you complete the test. Here are three things you have to do for a safe lane change:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<li>Use your signals first</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<li>Check your mirrors</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<li>Check the blind spot by looking at your turning side.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Failure to Yield</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If the signal is green and you prepare for a left turn, you have to stop before all coming traffic to see whether they are turning or coming straight and wait for the pedestrians to cross. After that, you can complete your left turn. So first you have to yield even if the light is green and there is no signal for a left turn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Don’t worry if you are in the intersection and the light turns red before you complete your turn. You entered legally on a green light. So other traffic has to wait for you to clear before they can proceed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Failure to Stop</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>In the United States, you have to stop completely if you see a “stop” sign as if this is a red light. Even if the intersection is empty and there is no pedestrian on the road, you have to “stop” completely. Most drivers also stop on the “limit line” or after they pass the “limit line” a little bit. All those are mistakes that make you fail the test.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If there is a school bus on the road and the red lights of the school bus are on. In this case, whether you are on the same side of the bus or the opposite side of the bus, you have to make a complete stop till the “red lights of the bus” go off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Illegal Left Turn</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>When you have a double left turn lane, you can get into the inside lane or outside lane. When you make a left turn on a green light, if you are in the inside lane, you have to end your left turn in the inside lane.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":134,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/leftturn1-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"Behind The Wheel Test Mistakes\" class=\"wp-image-134\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If you are on the outside lane, you can end your left turn in either lane of outside lanes. Most drivers do not their left turn in the same lane they have started. This is one of the common mistakes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":135,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/leftturn2-300x206.jpg\" alt=\"Behind The Wheel Test Mistakes\" class=\"wp-image-135\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Improper Speed</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":439,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/speedlimitschool.png\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/speedlimitschool-150x300.png\" alt=\"School Speed Limit in California\" class=\"wp-image-439\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>You have to obey <a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/car-accidents-not-reported-dmv/\" rel=\"nofollow\">speed limits</a> always. If the limit is 65 miles per hour, you have to drive at this limit or slower. Sometimes the weather and road conditions force you to drive slower. Otherwise, you shouldn’t drive too slow. This may cause congestion in the traffic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If you are in a school zone and it says “Speed limit 25 when children are present”, this means if kids are around walking in the pedestrian zone, your speed limit is 25. If there is no one then you can drive on the regular speed limit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Lack of Experience</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":442,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/driver2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/driver2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the wheel mistakes\" class=\"wp-image-442\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If you are not experienced enough, you’ll probably fail the driving test. There are some situations that you can learn by experience not by reading from the books. An ambulance is approaching and you don’t know what to do and you freeze in the car without anything. This will be a good reason for you to fail the test. So practice! Practice! Practice! before entering “Behind The Wheel Test”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Unfamiliar with Vehicle</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If you go to a driving test with a borrowed or rental car, probably you don’t know your vehicle’s properties very well. This may cause get excited about the test and make you panic. At the beginning of the test, the DMV examiner asks questions about the vehicle’s specific items such as how to open the trunk or flashlights. For example, it is raining and you don’t how to turn on your windshield wipers. You failed! Know your car before entering the test.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Poor Scanning</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>You have to scan everywhere during the “Behind The Wheel Test.” If you only look straight ahead and concentrate on what is in front of you, you can miss pedestrians who prepare to cross the street or you can miss the traffic signs. You have to scan sides, mirrors, and roads always while driving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Too Cautious</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Some people think that being extra cautious will make them pass the driving test. Caution is good but too much can create traffic hazards. If you are overly cautious, you can hesitate while you make your left turn and this may cause confusion among the other drivers. So be assertive and relax! It is not rocket science.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Unfamiliarity with Traffic Situations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Behind-the-wheel traffic test may take place in unfamiliar territory that you didn’t drive before. For example, you are in a commercial zone and there is no speed limit sign and you are driving over 40 miles per hour. Big mistake! You have to know that if there is no speed limit sign, the limit is 25 miles per hour by default. So it is better to go to the exam area earlier and check the surroundings and make yourself familiar with traffic situations such as roundabouts, traffic signals, speed limits, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If you want to pass the test, try to avoid ten common behind-the-wheel test mistakes that most applicants do. Otherwise, you have to take a test many times till you get your driver's license.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

If you heard the term \"Defensive Driving\" for the first time, read this article carefully. If you know it, then it is a good opportunity to check what you have learned so far.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">28 Tips for Defensive Driving</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>You can't control the road conditions, you can't control the weather. But it is up to you to control your vehicle. Defensive Driving lets you do that.  Here are the most common 28 tips for \"<strong>Defensive Driving</strong>\":</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Stay focused always</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":643,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving1-e1516919524508.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-643\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Distraction is your enemy and the 101 of safe driving starts with focusing. You always have to pay attention to the road and your vehicle. Research says that most collisions happen because of distraction. Drivers under 20 are the most prone to distractions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Always buckle up</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Seat belts reduce the risk of injury in a crash by 50 percent. I don't say it but <a href=\"http://nsc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Safety Council</a> says. If you drive very very slowly, it doesn't matter, buckle up. If you are just waiting in the car and waiting for someone, just buckle up. Buckling up will not kill you but not to buckle up may.  Between 2004 and 2008, 75,000 lives were saved by seat belts. This is an incredible number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Every driver is not a good driver</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>You may be a perfect driver with zero penalty points on your driver's license. But keep in mind that not every driver is a good driver. So don't count on other drivers and expect them to make mistakes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Don't drive too fast</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Speed is fatal, lethal and it is your enemy. Speed may increase your adrenaline level but at the same time, it reduces your chance of living a healthy and long life. According to US Census, 33 thousand fatalities were reported due to speeding in 2009.  Another research says that if you drive faster than average, it only gives you a maximum of 5 minutes advantage to reach your destination. Do you think is it worth to die for 5 minutes?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use safety devices</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Recent cars have more safety instruments. New technologies may save your and your kids' life.&nbsp; Large airbags, booster seats etc.&nbsp;Invest in the right child restraints and seat belt adjusters for your family, and don't forget to use them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Doubt is not your friend</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Rule is simple, if you have doubt, just yield to other driver. If you know you have the right of way, but another motorist seems to disagree, give in. Better to lose a bit of time than to get caught in a collision.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Stop! On Red</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Most intersection collisions happen because of red light. Of course it is you who are responsible not the red light. There may be some glare from setting sun or you may be in a hurry. The best practice is to slow down before each intersection and evaluate the situation. Never try to race the yellow light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Always signal in advance</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Confusion is the enemy of safe driving. Make your lane changes and turns predictable and smooth, and always signal in advance. \"Nationwide, neglected or improper turn signals cause 2 million car accidents a year,\" says Richard Ponziani, who conducted a recent study for the Society of Automotive Engineers. Failure to signal can invalidate your insurance claim after an accident, which means you will be financially responsible for any damage caused.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. If you are not Mad Max,&nbsp; forget Road Rage</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":644,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-644\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Road rage is not just an urban myth. Since you don't know who might be behind the wheel of that vehicle that just cut you off, it's safest to back away and overlook the offense. Road rage has led to murder over trivial offenses in all 50 states. Getting even could get you killed, not to mention the innocent drivers in your vicinity. If you suspect that another driver may be drunk, stay away, and alert the authorities as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Do not tailgate</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Tailgating leads to rear-end collisions, and you will be the one to foot the bill for the repairs. 1/3 of all traffic accidents are caused by tailgating, and could be prevented with proper distance. Allow at least two or three seconds of lead time in good weather and more in bad weather.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Monitor your blind spots</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>This is especially true of large vehicles, such as tractor-trailers. The rule of thumb for Defensive Driving is that if you can't see the driver in the truck mirror, he can't see you either. Accidents involving semi-trucks often prove fatal for the driver of a car.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Never drive drunk</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Even an over-the-counter cold medication can alter your response times, so assess yourself honestly before deciding to drive. The average drinker can only metabolize one drink per hour. One drink equates to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. If you are under the influence of any mind-altering substance, stay away from the wheel. Everyday 28 people die daily in the U.S. from drunk driving accidents.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Be cautious if it rains</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":646,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving4.jpg\" alt=\"Defensive Driving\" class=\"wp-image-646\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>When the roads are slippery, especially in a heavy downpour or the first thirty minutes of a storm, your braking times increase. Turn off cruise control. Add extra space between your vehicle and other vehicles. Slow down as much as is feasible. Learn to detect and react properly to hydroplaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Prepare for snowy weather</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Slow down, and use snow chains if you see snow accumulating on the highway, but do not use chains on ice. If you live in an area where snow and ice are common, invest in winter snow tires. Always turn off your cruise control if you suspect ice may be present.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Inflate your tires appropriately</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Properly inflated tires make for safer handling, and blowouts can cause an instant loss of control. So inflate your tires appropriately, and change them when they are worn if you want to be good at Defensive Driving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Use your headlights wisely</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Anytime visibility is impaired on winding roads, during fog, rain, snow, or low light, make sure you can be seen by turning on your headlights. Only use your high beams in low-traffic areas, and turn them down for oncoming drivers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Maintain your vehicle</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Regular oil changes and fluid checks can save you from surprise breakdowns on the road. If your car becomes disabled on a busy highway or interstate, the National Safety Council recommends that you try to pull over in the breakdown lane, if possible. Remember to use your turn signals, and watch for fast-moving cars. If you have parked a comfortable distance from traffic, lock the doors and wait for help. You are close to traffic! Then exit the vehicle, and find a safe place to stand, away from the side and rear of the car. If you cannot reach the breakdown lane, and your car is stopped in traffic, leave the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so, and wait for help in a secure location on the side of the road.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Respond safely to tailgaters</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If someone is following too closely, add twice as much space between your car and the car in front of yours. This increases your ability to see and prepare for a collision. Then carefully and gradually decrease your speed to slightly below the speed of surrounding traffic, and try to move into a right-hand lane, to let the tailgater pass. Do not hit the brakes suddenly, unless you are forced to do so to avoid a collision.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Keep a steady pace</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Sudden increases and decreases in speed, unexpected lane changes, and unpredictable stops make it hard for other drivers to anticipate your actions. Be predictable and avoid surprising anyone around you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Look far ahead of your vehicle</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Keep your eyes far down the road, and expect problems before you come to them. Look for erratic drivers, slow traffic, intersections, and highway debris.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Take a defensive driving course</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Many defensive driving classes are available online and in your area. This can make a great gift for a young <a href=\"https://therealbest.com/what-is-grout/\">family</a> member, or you can use it as a preventive exercise for yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Carry emergency equipment</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Carry emergency equipment. - a jack, spare tire, flashlight, first aid kit, and flares. You never know what you'll need in case of emergency and do not think that \"it ain't happen to you\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Lock your vehicle</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>To be a good Defensive Driver, you should at least have one car. So always lock your vehicle and&nbsp; take your keys with you when you leave it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. Be extra careful near schools</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Streets near schools often have reduced speed limits during school hours. The speed limit is 15 mph instead of 25 mph that are designated by signs with flashing lights. Though this limit may seem excessively low when you do not see any children, small kids can hide easily or make sudden movements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">25. Inspect your vehicle before ride</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>It’s important to inspect a vehicle, whether it’s a company truck or your own car, before hitting the road. If a driver notices an under-inflated tire or an oil patch before heading out, it can save time and annoyance and possibly prevent an accident.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">26. If you are sleepy, don't drive</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>You want to reach your destination as soon as possible but if your eyes give an emergency alert, do not insist on driving. Just pull over your car and take a quick nap at least 20 minutes. Being late is better than being dead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">27. Don't use handheld devices while driving</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":645,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/defensive-driving3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-645\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>It is illegal in most states using handheld devices while driving. Many modern cars have advanced Bluetooth systems that allow for hands free speech. You can adjust your car before hitting the road. Also don't text while driving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">28. Consider your physical condition before driving</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>A driver’s physical well-being is also important because hearing, vision, and fatigue can all affect your<br>driving ability. So it’s important to take stock of these factors before driving: Have you got your glasses with you? Did you have breakfast this morning? Did you get enough sleep?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Conclusion: <strong>Defensive Driving</strong> is a lifesaver technique for you, your loved ones, and other people in traffic.

      "slug": "real-defensive-driving",
      "content": "Everyday in the roads, tons of collisions, car crashes, accidents happen. There are many reasons of these accidents but one of them is on top of the agenda. It is called \"Human error\".  That is why <strong>\"Defensive Driving\"</strong> is crucial. As we humans, often neglect to rules, ignore laws and other drivers and do not improve ourselves to be better drivers.\n<h2>Interesting fact about Defensive Driving</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/streettaksi.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-728 size-full\" src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/streettaksi.jpg\" alt=\"Defensive Driving\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a>\n\nRecently a survey made by UK based newspaper Telegraph. Results are not surprising maybe but can explain why human error is a big factor in traffic accidents.  According to the Survey;  % 79 of people claim to be safe drivers and ascertain that they do their best to follow all rules of the road. But no matter how confident you are in your driving skills, you’re never far from risk.\n\nSo here is a simple test to understand whether you are really good at defensive driving or not. If you say yes to all of those questions below, you can consider yourself as a defensive driver.\n<h2>Do you trust other drivers too much?</h2>\nThere is saying \"Never trust anyone, even this person is your father.\" I don't know who said this first but it has some truth in it, especially when it comes to traffic. One of the common mistakes that drivers do is to trust other drivers. . This leads to one of the most common mistakes drivers tend to make. For example, if the other driver flashes with their headlamps at you and implying that the road is safe to proceed, you shouldn't trust this signal. Because you never know what does this mean actually. It may mean \"I am here\" or \"^Come on through\". So better be cautious!\n<h2>Are you observing your surroundings?</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/race1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-730 size-full\" src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/race1.jpg\" alt=\"Race\" width=\"960\" height=\"668\" /></a>\n\nYour answer should be a strong \"YES\". Defensive driving is all about being observant, anticipating problems and planning ahead.  It is not only checking your side mirrors, it is expecting something bad may happen at the road.\n<h2>Are you aware of indicators</h2>\nJust because the car in front of you is indicating left, doesn’t mean it will actually turn. Or while you are driving in the fog, you can't trust the car in front of you because the driver has the same limited view like you. Wait and see whether the driver will make a left turn or just stop.\n<h2>Do you create a safety bubble for defensive driving?</h2>\nFor a good defensive driving, you should always keep enough space for surprises, so that you can easily make your move when the accidents come to you. Always remember that however hard you are concentrating on the road, the person coming towards you might be messing with their phone, fiddling with the car stereo or just generally distracted. You can never be sure they’re going to do the right or safest thing.\n<h2>Are you pulling over in case of doubt?</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lamborgini.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-731 size-full\" src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lamborgini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"714\" /></a>\n\nNever compare yourself to other drivers. This also means never race with others. Someone behind you may drive like a formula 1 driver. This means he is either a maniac or a real formula 1 driver. So it is better to play it safe and avoid putting yourself in a dangerous position.\n<h2>Are you tailgating?</h2>\nThe simple answer for a good defensive driving; DON'T TAILGATE. To be patient while driving may extend your lifespan. So when you tailgate, you are taking many risks including a fatal injury.\n\nRead more about <a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/top-28-defensive-driving-tips/\">Defensive Driving</a>",

The downside of buy used cars is you'll never 100 percent sure about what happened to a used car since it hit the road first. Even if you buy the car from a close friend or a family member, the vehicle might have an ugly past. So as an early step, it is good to check the vehicle's history by using <a href=\"https://www.carfax.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carfax</a> or AutoCheck. You can learn whether the odometer has been rolled back or a car had a salvage title before. You can use the car's vehicle identification number AKA VIN and/or license plate to check the car's history. If you are lucky enough, you can talk to the car's previous owners or mechanic who checked the car before.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Talk to the seller first</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before seeing the car, you can have a nice conversation with the owner or seller of the used car to understand why they sell the car. Sometimes dealers do not put every detail on their ads, so you can get more information beforehand. So it is better to make the negotiation later on even it is sometimes tempting to do the negotiation in the early stages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>No rush, first test the car</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":779,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/usedcar2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/usedcar2.jpg\" alt=\"buy used cars\" class=\"wp-image-779\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A test drive is a good way to understand a car's condition. Sometimes your dream car may have issues like not enough space for passengers or for kids. Or even you can bang your head while getting out of the car. Sometimes the odometer may show fewer numbers but the car's interior may look old. You can understand whether the ex-owners of the car treated this car badly or in a good way by looking at the leather, fabric, the condition of windows, mirrors, etc. It is also good to make an eye-check to understand the conditions of tires, air-conditioning systems, headlights, brakes, and so on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Take an opinion of a third party</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, it is good to have a mechanic inspect before buying used cars. Also if you have a friend, who is good at inspecting, you can have him or she check the car or make the test-drive. A second eye always an added value. An inspection will not cost you much but probably it will protect you from future losses. Also if it is a CPO car, there's already been an inspection and a warranty is in place, so there is little reason to take it to a mechanic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Negotiate the price</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Negotiation might be a burden for some people. But don't forget that maybe the other party hates negotiation as well. So if you are not too rich, it is better to negotiate. You can first check all the price points that you get from the internet and you can decide on an average point. So you can use this as your target price point. If the seller's price sounds good, you can go for it and buy the car.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Complete the paperwork</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are at a dealership, you'll sign the contract in the finance and insurance office. There, you will likely be offered additional items, such as a warranty, anti-theft devices, prepaid service plans, or fabric protection. Review the dealership sales contract thoroughly. In most states, it lists the cost of the vehicle, a documentation fee, possibly a small charge for a smog certificate, sales tax, and license fees.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are buying a car from an individual owner, make sure the seller properly transfers the title and registration to you. Before money changes hands, ask for the title (the pink slip) and have the seller sign it over to you. Rules governing vehicle registration and licensing vary from state to state.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Check due registration fees before buying</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your car might have some past-due registration fees.

So be careful when you return right and be %100 sure that your left-hand side is completely empty. Laguna Hills DMV Driving Test route is not that difficult if you drive carefully.

      "title": "Top 50 bad driving habits that may shorten your life",
      "slug": "bad-driving-habits",
      "content": "In US roads, there are more than 250 million cars. This incredible number also brings many problems with it. More cars on the road doesn't necessarily mean more accidents or car collisions but it means we need to educate more people to avoid more injuries and deaths. Having said that, I did a list of 50 bad driving habits that have the potential to shorten your life\nhttps://youtu.be/svw0ITHJJFM\n<h1 style=\"color: #b71212;\">Top 50 Bad Driving Habits</h1>\nAccording to World Health Organization<sup>[<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>]</sup>, average road fatalities per 100.000 inhabitants per year is 17.4. US rank is 60<sup>th</sup> according to same statistics. This is a very big contradiction with United Nations Human Development Index. This index<a href=\"#ref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> shows how well developed countries in terms of humanly living. In this list US is number 10.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hdi.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1401\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hdi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"966\" height=\"501\" /></a>\n\nHere is my list for 50 bad driving habits.\n<h2>1. Talking on a Cell Phone</h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1438\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"986\"]<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/injurymap.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1438\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/injurymap.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Driving Habits\" width=\"986\" height=\"682\" /></a> Image Courtersy: http://www.researchamerica.org[/caption]\n\nThis is by far the very first reason of many fatalities in the roads. It is one of the main distraction reasons. According to a study released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <sup>[<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>]</sup> and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute , when a driver loses attention just only for 3 seconds,  it may lead a serious traffic accidents or near miss. This study shows that 80 percent of automobile accidents involve some kind of distraction that happens in just 3 seconds. Well, it might be boring when the traffic is jammed and you want to play with cell phone but choose one of them; live longer or talk longer?\n<h2>2. Sending Text Messages</h2>\nThis is one of the other reasons of accidents on the roads. While texting may shift from SMS to WhatsApp and other similar internet based texting services with call and video option, <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article123126354.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the danger to use a mobile phone for texting didn't change at all.</a> Texting which is a major distraction factor may increase the risk of a car accident more than 23 times.  The researchers also claims that sending text messages via your mobile phone may create  a true crash epidemic if texting continues to grow in popularity. <sup>[<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>]</sup>\n<h2>3. Trying to Reach a Moving Object</h2>\nMany of us are familiar with similar scenes from Hollywood movies. While our antagonist or protagonist is trying to reach something in the glove-box, accidents happen. It is a very common reason for accidents that it became a movie cliche as well. For a safe drive, you must give the road your full attention. Drivers that divert their awareness  risk the lives of the other drivers on the road.\n<h2>4. Looking at an Object or Event Outside of the Vehicle</h2>\nWell I think any of who reads this article may witness a similar incident while driving. There may be an ambulance near the road because of an accident and almost all drivers slow down to see the crash scene and this one moment may result car collisions. Even if you see an UFO flying over your car, keep your eyes on your steering wheel for safety. To be abducted by an alien might be safer than being dead.\n<h2>5. Reading a Book or Newspaper</h2>\nYou may an avid read but do you need to read it while driving? Even the novel you are reading is the only one single copy in the world, is it worth to risk your life and others life on the road?\n<h2>6. Eating  While Driving</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sf6-e1518300612474.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1285 alignright\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sf6-e1518300612474.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /></a>\n\nEveryone is busy these days. You have no time to eat your lunch and you have to catch up the next meeting on time so you choose to eat while driving. But do you know, eating while driving is also another major factor of distraction. That one moment when you leave the steering wheel to take an apple from your lunch-box may be your last moment. Be careful! Try to eat at your <a href=\"https://www.marblesystems.com/kitchen-backsplash-ideas-2020/\">kitchen</a> before you drive.\n<h2>7. Applying Make Up</h2>\nThis scene is also very familiar to many of us. Especially when the traffic light is red, you can think of this short moment is a good opportunity to refresh your makeup. But this is also the moment that you close your eye-sight in front of you or something that prevents you seeing the traffic light. So <a href=\"http://blogs.findlaw.com/legalgrounds/2015/04/woman-gets-ticket-for-putting-on-makeup-while-driving.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">applying make up</a> also seems one of the important bad driving habits and major reason for distraction.\n<h2>8. Speeding</h2>\nYou’ve seen many drivers who ignore speed limit and sometimes go over 30 mph over the limit. Speed may kill and traveling above the speed limit is one of the common reasons for accidents. Your reaction time is directly related to your speed. If you go faster, your reactions become slower. It is one of the bad driving habits that has to change immediately. Speed limits were set as a result of scientific research made by traffic engineers. So try to avoid this bad driving habit because even if you exceed the speed limit just 10%, this may cause an accident in a wrong place.\n<h2>9. Drunk Driving</h2>\nEach year, thousands of car accidents with drunk drivers cause tragedy and grief, making it one of the top causes of automobile accidents. It is very obvious that when you drink, you'll lose your sense of vision and hearing and also you'll lose muscle coordination. This is  a deadly combination for driving a car. In 2007 alone, about 13,000 wrongful deaths occurred in fatal car accidents with drunk drivers. The dark side of driving under influence is that most of the times he drunk driver survives, but tragically, innocent people are usually killed. Quit this very bad driving habit and also if possible quit drinking heavily and learn to drink responsibly.\n<h2>10. Driving Under Influence of Drugs</h2>\nDrug may mean many things. We are not only talking about illegal drugs here but some type of prescription medicine is also considered as drug such as depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens. Each drug affects the human brain in a distinctly different way. As we all know marijuana or similar drugs have highly addictive substance that impacts brain's reaction time, coordination and judgment. Thus usage of these materials will cause accidents.  Well while some form weed is not illegal in California, we only recommend you not to use this substance while driving. We are not living in 70's when smoking while driving may seem funny as in Cheech and Chong movies.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCXqbjo6cb0\n<h2>11. Improper Turns</h2>\nThere are thousands of serious car accident every year that are caused by improper turning. This <strong>bad driving habit</strong> needs to be changed forever. Wrong turn may put a car directly in front of or into the path of an oncoming vehicle. A simple oversight of looking for the blind spots may prevent you making an accident. Improper turns is one of the major causes of car accidents and often leads to injuries or death.\n\n<strong>Here is \"Don'ts\" of Turns: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Do not turn when there is a no turn on red sign.</li>\n \t<li>Do not turn without a complete stop or without yielding.</li>\n \t<li>Do not turn when there is red light that says \"don't turn\".</li>\n \t<li>Do not forget to use your signals before turning</li>\n \t<li>Do not turn having right of way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>12. Running Red Lights</h2>\nEveryone knows that red means stop. If you don't stop on red usually, you have a bad driving habit. Running on red is one of the cause of wrongful deaths because it is dangerous and often cause side impact damages to other cars at high speeds.\n<h2>13. Running a Stop Sign</h2>\nStop signs are important part of traffic.  You must completely make a full stop on stop signs. If you have a bad driving habit like not to stop on stop sign, you can be a real threat to other drivers or pedestrians. Also running a stop sign may cost you $238 as traffic ticket in California.\n<h2>14. Improper Lane Change</h2>\nAnother bad driving habit is not change lanes properly. Don't rush to change the lane because there is always a good moment for it. If you don't change lane safely or zigzagging with your car, you risk other driver's life. <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/video/lets_drive/10reasons/1_Unsafe_Lane_Change\" rel=\"nofollow\">For a proper and safe lane change,</a> you should signal at least 100 feet before lane change, use your turn signal, check your blind spots and proceed carefully.\n<h2>15. Wrong-Way Driving</h2>\nWell this is not only a bad driving habit, it is also a lethal game that you don't want to play. You can mistakenly turn to a street and may pose a big threat other driver's life. So be careful and check \"wrong way\" signs always. If you are not a stunt or in a movie, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Wrong-Way-Driver-Bronx-River-Parkway-Crash-Head-on-Injuries-Yonkers-New-York-473526453.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">never drive in wrong way. </a>\n<h2>16. Tailgating</h2>\nYou may be an impatient driver or in a hurry but this doesn't give you the right to tailgate to other drivers. What if the driver in front of you breaks suddenly or panics when there is a tailgated car behind his or her car. Remember the 3 seconds rule and always leave at least 3 seconds driving distance between you and the car in front of you. This bad driving habit was a <a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/transport/tailgating-caused-22-deaths-and-16-severe-injuries-last-year-1.1452872\" rel=\"nofollow\">cause of 22 deaths only in 204.</a>\n<h2>17. Drowsy driving</h2>\nIf you are too tired, too sleepy or too exhausted, this means you are drowsy and probably this will impact your driving skills. Especially at night or very close to down, drowsy driving can cause accidents. You can easily find many news because of people fall asleep at the wheel. Quit this bad driving habit.<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyamohn/2016/08/08/nearly-83-6-million-american-drivers-are-sleep-deprived-new-report-highlights-dangers-high-cost/#5743a86f4007\" rel=\"nofollow\"> If you are too drowsy, pull over and have a quick nap. It is better than an eternal sleep</a>.\n<h2>18. Deadly curves</h2>\nSome people call them dead man’s curves, but everyone should be careful when approaching a curve. It is easy to lose control of the vehicle along a dangerous curve and this may be deadly. If you have a bad driving habit like speeding up when you approach curves, quit it immediately. Drive cautiously and be safe, you are not in an F-1 race.\n<h2>19. Street racing</h2>\nStreet race! Come on, this is not a Fast and Furious movie. This is real life and there are no turbo engines, nitros and other fancy gadgets. if you want to die young with a handsome simple, it is up to you. Otherwise avoid this bad driving habit and avoid danger. You can easily risk your life and other people's life just because of your street racing fantasy.\n<h2>20. Suddenly braking</h2>\nThis may seem odd but sudden breaks may cause car accidents. This bad driving habit is not only one of the causes of accidents but it is also a bad habit to harm your car's brakes.\n<h2>21. Driving without headlights</h2>\nIf you are not a secret spy and have a meaningful reason to hide yourself, don't turn off your headlights or if they are broken, get them fixed immediately.\n<h2>22. Accelerating on yellow light</h2>\nSome drivers may be really impatient and they don't give enough attention to the traffic lights. There is an order while the traffic lights are working. If it is red and yellow together, this means green light is coming afterwards. But if it is only yellow, this means it is going to turn red, not to green. So when you see a yellow light, you have to slow down. If you accelerate, this means you have a <strong>bad driving habit</strong> that may cause to tragic accidents which may lead casualties.\n<h2>23. Parking to wrong spaces</h2>\nParking to non-parking areas may not be deadly but it is certainly a bad driving habit. When you park your car to a non-parking zone, it may prevent the traffic flow and may cause other drivers involve in car collisions.\n<h2>24. Road rage</h2>\nIf you are in unpleasant situation with another driver, it is easy to get angry. But anger brings nothing than harm. By tailgating another driver in anger or speeding past another driver only to pull in front of them and brake, these bad driving habits cause too man car accidents each year. If you can't keep your calm at traffic, better see a doctor instead of racing and quit this bad driving habit.\n<h2>25. Driving without a seat belt</h2>\nThis may not be so common in California but in other areas of US may be also in California, millions of drivers use their cars without a seat belt buckled up.  The most reliable method of saving lives and preventing injuries from occurring is to wear a seat belt. Here are some facts that encourage to wear a seat belt while driving.<sup>[<a href=\"#ref5\">5</a>]</sup>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Seat belts can reduce injury and death rates by 50%</li>\n \t<li>Adults aged 18-34 are less likely to wear seat belts than those 35 or older</li>\n \t<li>Men are 10% less likely to wear seat belts than women</li>\n \t<li>58% of teen drivers killed in crashes were not wearing a seat belt in 2011.</li>\n \t<li>Teens have the lowest seat belt use of any other age group</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>26. Ignoring child passenger safety</h2>\nThis bad driving habit is one of the top reasons of child death in car accidents. In 2015 only, 1,346 children under age 15 were killed in motor vehicle crashes. That's more than three children every day. Properly securing children in safety seats goes a long way in keeping them safer.\n<blockquote>A reminder:  Child Passenger Safety Week is Sept. 23-29, 2018</blockquote>\n<h2>27.  Ignoring Traffic Signs</h2>\nDo you blow through stop signs or fail to yield when it’s required of you?  Those signs are there for a reason, and even if no one’s around, you should obey them. You never know when a car or pedestrian might come out of nowhere, or even a cop!\n<h2>28. Not Checking Blind Spots</h2>\nBlind spots are implicitly dangerous, but not even trying to check them is more dangerous. Drivers who have a bad driving habit may not have a tendency to start moving over into other lanes and nearly colliding with other cars. This may be a reason for  anxiety and distraction, Quit this bad driving habit and check your mirrors before changing lanes, and don't forget to check blind spots with moving your head right or left. <sup>[<a href=\"#ref6\">6</a>]</sup>\n<h2>29. Merging improperly</h2>\nHow many times have you been on a freeway on-ramp and found yourself behind someone who doesn’t understand how to merge? These slow drivers not only slow the flow of traffic, but also they put others in danger. There are also some drivers who are in a hurry. They act as if they are in a racing and try to put themselves in front of other cars. This is also wrong and a bad driving habit.\n<h2>30. Not using turn signals</h2>\nBelieve me there is a reason why car makers invent turn signals. If you don’t tell other people where you’re going, how can you expect them to know? Changing lanes or turning without signaling throws others off, and it could put you in harm’s way. If you don't turn on your signal while slowing down, other cars behind you get caught off guard.\n<h2>31. Cutting other cars off</h2>\nYou may be in a hurry but believe me, everyone in California is in hurry. So cutting other cars off is not a solution to make you arrive early to your destination. Cutting off is a dangerous and bad driving habit. When you jump in front of another car, you increase the risk of being hit from behind because maybe the other driver is not paying attention.  Don’t put yourself in this situation! What a bad driving habit!\n<h2>32. Driving with headphones on</h2>\nListening to music on your car radio can be distracting enough. If this is not enough for distraction, you can wear your headphones. But doing so, you make it impossible for yourself to hear important noises like horns, alarms or emergency vehicle sirens. This is not only a bad driving habit but also it is illegal in most states.\n<h1 style=\"color: #b71212;\">Bad Driving Habits that may damage your car</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/highway-e1518125094719.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1436\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/highway-e1518125094719.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Driving Habits\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" /></a>\nSo far we reviewed bad driving habits that may cause direct impact to your life or other people's lives. But there are other bad driving habits which have a bad impact on your car's health. So if you car is healthy, then this means you'll be healthier and you'll be able to avoid nasty situations while driving. <sup>[<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>]</sup>\n<h2>33. Resting your hand on the shifter</h2>\nUnless you're actively changing gears, there's no reason to touch the shifter. Resting your hand on the shifter places weight on the transmission's bushings and synchronizers, causing internal wear. Keeping both hands on the steering wheel, and only taking one off to switch gears, is the best idea. This is bad driving habit that can damage your car.\n<h2>34. Not using the parking break</h2>\nNeglecting to use the parking brake forces the entire weight of your vehicle to rest on the parking pawl, which is one little piece of metal within the transmission. Doing this could cause the parking pawl to eventually wear out and break, making \"P\" on your shifter effectively useless. Use the parking brake every time – there's really no reason not to. You can get rid of this bad driving habit.\n<h2>35. Hauling unneeded weight</h2>\nYou may not drive a Lotus, but the phrase \"simplify, and add lightness\" applies to every car. We're not advocating stripping out sound deadening or removing the back seats, but you should clear out unneeded cargo from your car. Every pound of extra weight impacts fuel economy and handling, plus causes extra stress on suspension, brake, and drive-train components. Give your interior and trunk a thorough clean so you're only carrying the essentials.\n<h2>36. Keeping small amount fuel on tank</h2>\nSometimes the cost of a full tank of gas doesn't fit into your budget, so you only add a gallon or two at a time. Most drivers don't know that this can lead to costly repairs further down the road. Modern fuel pumps are cooled by being submerged in fuel, so driving with only a small amount of fuel causes it to heat up and wear out more quickly. Keeping your gas tank at least a quarter full helps prevent this.\n<h2>37. Hard starts and stops</h2>\nThis one's a no-brainer. Mashing on the gas can be fun, but uses significantly more fuel than gradually applying throttle. Sudden stops are sometimes necessary, but cause faster wear to the brake pads and rotors. Looking ahead, planning ahead, and pressing on the pedals smoothly is the best strategy. So always try to avoid this bad driving habit.\n<h2>38. Revving the Engine When It's Cold</h2>\nIt's not a bad idea to let the engine idle for a minute or two after a cold start. This helps it warm up and gives the oil some time to circulate. However, you should resist the urge to rev the engine when it's cold. Sure, the exhaust sounds great, but revving it when it's cold causes abrupt temperature changes that can damage components. It also causes undue wear on parts of the engine that haven't been lubricated by thorough oil circulation. Your engine will sound better, and rev more smoothly, once it's had a chance to warm up.\n<h2>39. Riding the Clutch</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/clutch-e1518125945209.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1445\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/clutch-e1518125945209.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" /></a>\n\nYou're at a stop light in your manual transmission car. You're pressing on the clutch, ready to drop it as soon as the light turns green. All that time spent waiting with the clutch in damages the pressure plate, release bearing, and release arm. Riding the clutch causes its surfaces graze against each other, wearing them down and opening the possibility for sudden failure. It's better to be stopped with the clutch out and shifter in neutral, only pressing the clutch and engaging gear when the light turns green.\n<h2>40. Switching From Reverse to Drive Before Stopping Completely</h2>\nWhen you're trying to fit into a tight parking spot, it's common to shift from reverse to drive while still slowly rolling backwards. This habit should be avoided at all costs. Doing so places strain on the drive train when it's suddenly forced to move in the opposite direction. Simply take that extra moment to make sure you're completely stopped before switching from reverse to drive.\n<h2>41. Dragging the Brakes Downhill</h2>\nDriving down a steep hill can be daunting, so you rest your foot on the brake pedal to be ready to slow down at a moment's notice. This causes strain and heat to build up in the brake system, wearing out components like brake pads and rotors. Instead, you should shift into a lower gear when you're driving downhill. This will cause engine braking, which helps slow the car down through natural drivetrain decompression. You'll find that engine braking can be as effective as regular braking in maintaining your downhill speed.\n<h2>42. Ignoring Warning Signs of Your car</h2>\nIt's easy to ignore those little squeaks, intermittent rattles, or other unusual noises your car makes. Those sounds are warning signs that something's wearing out or about to go wrong. Don't wait to find out the cause of the noise, or it may make itself abundantly clear at the worst possible time. If your car is making strange sounds or giving you other warning signs, it's important to inspect the issue right away.\n<h1 style=\"color: #b71212;\">Here are some bonus facts about bad driving habits</h1>\n<h2>43. Driving too fast for the weather conditions</h2>\nWhen the weather gets bad, slowing down is the best way to avoid an accident. This goes back to that physics thing. Unfortunately, not everyone gets that. All-wheel drive isn't an excuse for driving fast in inclement weather. When the road surface is slippery, a 3,500- to 5,000-pound vehicle will probably skid if you need to slow down in a hurry. According to the Federal Highway Administration, 24 percent of all vehicle crashes are weather related. That's a good reason to slow down and leave a little space between your car and the one in front.  <sup>[<a href=\"#ref8\">8</a>]</sup>\n<h2>44. Drafting tractor trailers</h2>\nFollowing closely behind a tractor trailer can increase your fuel economy. That doesn't mean you should do it. Drafting works for NASCAR drivers, so it makes sense that a 4,000-pound car can \"hide\" in the low pressure zone behind a 13-foot-tall, 80,000-pound big rig. Back in 2007, the MythBusters even proved that it worked. But they also pointed out that following closer than 150 feet behind a truck is really dangerous. Even that distance gives a driver less than two seconds to react if the trucker suddenly slams on the brakes. Other things to consider are that truck drivers can't see what's directly behind them, and the relationship between trailer heights and car hood heights is a recipe for decapitation.  <sup>[<a href=\"#ref9\">9</a>]</sup>\n<h2>45. Failure to yield the right of way</h2>\nOne of the leading causes of accidents, hands down, is failure to yield the right of way. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that it's the top cause of accidents among drivers aged 70 and older, particularly on freeway merge ramps. In Uncommon Carriers, his book about long haul truckers, John McPhee points out that space cadets in the merge lane are a constant source of teeth-grinding anxiety for the people driving 80,000-pound big rigs. Another facet of failure to yield that's more prevalent in cities is running stop signs and red lights. Drivers coming from other directions expect the intersection to be clear when the light on their end turns green. Once again, predictability is good.\n<h2>46. Disregarding the speed limit</h2>\nThough posted speed limits vary by state, use the following ranges as a general guide if you don't see a posted limit:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Residential area: 15-30 mph</li>\n \t<li>Undivided road (rural): 40-55 mph</li>\n \t<li>Divided road (rural): 55-70 mph</li>\n \t<li>Freeway: 55-65 mph</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 style=\"color: #b71212;\">These last 4 bad driving habits are unique to California.</h1>\nSo if you want to add more to my list; feel free to <a href=\"mailto: admin@dmvcalifornia.us\">contact me. </a>\n<h2>47. The California Cut</h2>\nYou’ll see this lethal maneuver every time you drive on the freeway: what happens is that someone realizes that the next freeway exit is theirs, and that they’re way over in the fast lane, with less than one hundred meters to the exit, or they’re just tired of driving in the rightmost lane and decide to get into the fast lane several lanes over.  <sup>[<a href=\"#ref10\">10</a>]</sup>  The usual solution is the “California Cut” — a multi-lane cut across the traffic, making a beeline for the exit or the fast lane, cutting an oblivious swath through fast moving traffic. This causes (at best) screeched tires, heart-stopping swerves, and traffic problems for everyone around the lane-cutter. Why couldn’t they wait for the next exit? Who knows?\n<h2>48. Assault stereos</h2>\nIf you’re new to America you might be astonished by the common use of violently loud car sound systems in urban and suburban areas. These things can shake other cars from across the road, and closing the windows won’t make the noise go away. Assault stereos are easily audible whole city blocks from the source; many Death Cars have assault stereos. When a car equipped with an assault stereo comes up behind or beside you, there’s little you can do but try to let it get well in front of you, and hope you don’t end up behind or beside it at the next lights.\n<h2>49. Death Cars</h2>\nDeath cars are large, usually old and battered, American cars driven by young males, sometimes sub-teenage, nearly always unlicensed or uninsured, who have nothing to lose by causing traffic havoc or accidents. You develop a sixth sense for death cars after a while, but as with most of these things, there’s not a lot you can do when one’s coming at you on the wrong side of the road at forty miles an hour. Your best bet is to avoid known Death Car areas  and steer clear of any large old American cars, especially ones weaving along the road at high speed. Death Cars  are guaranteed not to stay around if they cause or are part of an accident. Death Car drivers are likely to be armed; it’s best not to argue with them.\n<h2>50. Self-righteous or clueless cyclists and skaters</h2>\nPlaces like Berkeley, Santa Monica, San Francisco, Oakland, Venice in L.A. or Palo Alto have a high proportion of people who suddenly become transformed by the act of riding a bicycle or skateboard. Mostly the transformation is fairly harmless, but in quite a few cases the person becomes either unbearably self-righteous, or under the impression they’re invulnerable. Typical symptoms of this are cyclists and boarders monopolizing entire traffic lanes in heavy fast-moving traffic or  running red lights or stop signs without even slowing down then abusing you for not screeching to a halt for them when they run the red light directly in front of you.\n<h3 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"references\">References</h3>\n\n<hr />\n<p id=\"ref1\">[1] http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/TableA2.pdf?ua=1</p>\n<p id=\"ref2\">[2] http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI</p>\n<p id=\"ref3\">[3] https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving</p>\n<p id=\"ref4\">[4] https://seriousaccidents.com/legal-advice/top-causes-of-car-accidents/driver-distractions/</p>\n<p id=\"ref5\">[5] http://www.vdriveusa.com/resources/driving-without-a-seat-belt-statistics.php</p>\n<p id=\"ref6\">[6] https://www.idrivesafely.com/blog/top-ten-worst-driving-habits/</p>\n<p id=\"ref7\">[7] https://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/08/10-bad-driving-habits-that-damage-your-car/</p>\n<p id=\"ref8\">[8] http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a4418/feature-the-9-most-dangerous-things-drivers-do/</p>\n<p id=\"ref9\">[9] https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/time-to-break-these-5-bad-driving-habits</p>\n<p id=\"ref10\">[10] http://www.californiadriving.com/california-driving-bad-habits-worse/</p>",

In some countries like United Kingdom and India, the traffic flows on the left, contrary to many European countries and US. Other than that, there are no big, major differences.\n\nWho enters the driving test? Basically, we can put this into three categories.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Newcomers:</strong> The people, mostly youngster who wants to get their first driving license.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Senior Drivers:</strong> In California, if you are over 70; you have to go to local DMV office to renew your driver license and in some cases, they may want you to take the behind the wheel test again.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Immigrants:</strong> This category may include from F-1 students to tourists, legal or illegal any type of immigrants who move to US for a particular reason.</li>\n</ol>\nTypically to pass the road test or behind the wheel test, you must not make more than 30 regular errors and zero critical errors.\n\nCheck this out the learn what are the regular errors and what are the critical errors:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/driving-performance-evaluation-score-sheet/\">Driving Performance Evaluation Score Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>A typical road test will take around 25 to 30 minutes and the routes for the tests are almost same all the time. There will be an examiner with you while you are driving and here come the very important driving test tips right here.</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/COMMON-MISTAKES-ON-ROAD-TEST.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px dashed #00c4cc;\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/COMMON-MISTAKES-ON-ROAD-TEST-410x1024.png\" alt=\"driving test tips \" width=\"429\" height=\"1071\" /></a>\n<h1>Driving Test Tips</h1>\nIf you are from another country and immigrate to US, probably you have lots of driving experience in your home country. You may have a valid driving license for a long time and you can consider yourself like a pro driver. But; this is not your home country. This is USA and things are a bit different here.\n\nFirst of all; the examiners take their job very seriously and they will behave you as if you are decomposing the atom, not driving a car. If you are lucky, you can find a smiling face but mostly when they understand that you are a foreigner, their attitude will completely change and your chance of passing the road test will diminish.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/distractio2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1407\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/distractio2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"441\" height=\"304\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/distraction1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1405\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/distraction1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"304\" /></a>\n<h3>TIP ONE:  Try to get your examiner’s sympathy won’t work.</h3>\nYou can think that you are experienced enough to pass the test at your first attempt. This will be one of the biggest mistake ever that will lead you to fail.\n<h3>TIP TWO: Your past experience doesn’t count in USA.</h3>\nI know many people who are professional drivers in their home country and yet, they still failed DMV Road Test. If you just arrived US, you’ll also probably fail because you’ll not have enough data about traffic rules, the signs and other traffic related factors in US.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dmvaccident.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1546\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dmvaccident.jpg\" alt=\"driving test tips \" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" /></a>\n\nA simple example is the location of traffic lights. In most countries, the traffic lights will be in front of you, parallel to the white line but in US, traffic lights located on the other side of road. So, if you pass the white line just because to stop in front of lights, you’ll not only fail the test but also, you’ll cause an accident. I know, many of you will think this is a stupid mistake but it may happen. The important bit is you have to familiarize yourself to the surroundings, traffic signs and other major factors.\n<h3>TIP THREE: Practice the Road Test Route</h3>\nThis is our secret recipe. Or this is a secret most people know but for a reason never use it. DMV offices are very clumsy and process is so slow.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0woPde7OE1k\n\nThis scene from Zootopia animation very well defines the process in DMV. Don’t mad at them. There 250 million vehicles in US and lots of bureaucracy. But this is also an advantage for you because DMV rarely changes their testing routes. Here is an example below:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/laguna-hills-dmv-driving-test/\">DMV Laguna Hills Testing Route</a></li>\n</ul>\nIf you don’t know the route, you can go to DMV early and observe the examiners. You can follow them but I don’t recommend this because they may think you are some sort of freak. You can get information from your family or friends who took the exam before.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/curve-e1519935337556.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-799\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/curve-e1519935337556.jpg\" alt=\"driving test tips\" width=\"800\" height=\"442\" /></a>\n\nAfter you learn the route, take a friend that you trust and pretend that he or she is your examiner. You can download the score-sheet here and drive this route unless you make zero mistake. As I said earlier, a typical road test will take around 25-30 minutes. So I recommend you test the route on Sunday first and then a week day because you have to drive while there are actual real traffic just like a normal day.\n<h2>Don't Ignore These Driving Test Tips</h2>\nWhile you drive;\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check the traffic signs in this route</li>\n \t<li>Check the speed limits because there may be a school nearby and the speed limit will change automatically.</li>\n \t<li>Check any construction sites because rules may vary while you are near a construction field.</li>\n \t<li>Check if there are any intersection or blind spots, curves that may prevent your view while driving.</li>\n \t<li>Practice everything from beginning to the end with your pseudo examiner and let him or her to be harsh on you.</li>\n \t<li>More you practice, more likely you’ll pass the road test in your first attempt.</li>\n \t<li>Don’t forget: most successful keynote speakers or leaders practice in front of a mirror before they make their actual speech. This is no different than that. The route is your mirror and the only cure for your anxiety and excitement in the actual, real road test is your experience on the route.</li>\n</ul>",

If you get caught while Driving Under Influence, you can involve a car crash that may cause death or fatal injuries. Also you can be jailed up to 1 year at least. So it is important to know DUI California Limits.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drivinglady.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1610\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drivinglady.jpg\" alt=\"DUI California Limits\" width=\"1523\" height=\"1135\" /></a>\n\nIt is completely illegal to drive with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.08% or more in California. This limits vary for commercial drivers and drivers under 21 years old. If you are a commercial driver, limit is 0.04% and for drivers under 21, it is 0.01% only. If you live in California and you are not sure about the DUI limits, here is a table.\n<h1>DUI California Limits</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DUI-California-Limits.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1603\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DUI-California-Limits.jpg\" alt=\"DUI California Limits\" width=\"1292\" height=\"764\" /></a>The table shows how alcohol effects drivers, based on gender and weight. Other than gender and weight, number and strength of drinks, the time period that you take the drink or certain medical conditions may affect the body.

      "slug": "international-student-driver-license",
      "content": "If you are an international student who are currently in United States, you must formally apply to get a driver license. But things may be complicated if you don't know the procedures. Different states may have different rules. Keeping in mind this possibility, we'll outline the general process to get an international student driver license quickly and with ease.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZILES86M7Ic\n<h2>International Student Driver License</h2>\nIn California, to get an international student driver license is somewhat easy. First of all, you have to get an <a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/dmv-appointment/\">appointment from your DMV</a> office. There are two ways of getting an appointment. By phone or by applying on DMV website or simply by going to nearest DMV office. Each year, millions of people apply to get a new driver license or to renew their driver license. This means chances are; if you go to a local DMV office, you'll at least wait 4-5 hours to start your process because there are always long lines in front of DMV offices.\n<blockquote>Tip: Check less populated areas nearby and try your chance by visiting the office early in the morning. <a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/dmv-offices/\">Here</a> is a list of all DMV offices in California.</blockquote>\nIf you apply on the internet, you'll not get your appointment in 2-3 weeks time. Don't forget that DMV works very slowly in California. You have to prepared for your appointment.\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/students.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1631 \" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/students-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"international student driver license\" width=\"678\" height=\"449\" /></a>\n<h2>Required Documents</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WhatsApp-Image-2017-10-13-at-15.44.12.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-596\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WhatsApp-Image-2017-10-13-at-15.44.12-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"international student driver license\" width=\"249\" height=\"332\" /></a>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A valid passport</li>\n \t<li>I-94 document (this shows your arrival to USA on it, <a href=\"https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/\">check</a> this website to get it)</li>\n \t<li>Your I-20 document</li>\n \t<li>Social Security Card only for J-1 Scholars (Note: Regular F-1 students are not required an SSN or work permit to get driver license in CA)</li>\n \t<li>At least two residency verification form (This may be any two utility bills like electric, gas, internet or cable tv)</li>\n</ul>\nSo with this document, you'll fill an application form in DMV office. If you have your international driver license, bring it with you too. DMV officer will examine your eye-sight first. After this, they will take your photo. Don't forget that this photo will be the same photo on your driver license. If you are someone who cares his/her personal look, better get prepared before taking a photo.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Practice for Written and Driving Tests</h2>\nYou have to take the written test. Written tests are available in most languages online but not all of them. You can choose to take the written test in your native tongue. If you are lucky, you'll take a computer test, if not you'll get a paper based test. Never trust your driving abilities. Because some rules may be different than your home country. So better work hard before taking the written test.\n\nAfter the written test, you need to take another appointment for actual driving test aka <a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/dmv-behind-the-wheel-test/\">behind the wheel test.</a>\n\nWhether you are a fantastic driver or a formula-1 racer in your home country, you have to get prepared for driving test if you want to take the test in your first attempt. Most people do not pass the test in the first attempt. DMV officers in California take it very seriously and if they sense that you are new in the country, chances are you'll fail in the first attempt. So practicing the test route might be a good starting point.\n<h2>Temporary Driver License</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/temporarylicense.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1634 size-large alignleft\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/temporarylicense-1024x639.jpg\" alt=\"International Student Driver License\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" /></a>\n\nAfter you pass the test, they give you a \"temporary driver license\". This is basically half A-4 size printed document with no photo on it. You have to wait a couple of months to get your actual driver license. Because you are an F-1 or J-1 student who wants to get an <strong>\"international student driver license\",</strong> your information goes to DMV Center in Sacramento and to Homeland Security of course.\n\nIf you have a very common name or a name that may resemble to some people who are involved in suspicious federal activity, the duration of getting your driver license will be much more than you expect. In fact, it may take several months, even 6 to 9 months at best.\n\nMeanwhile, your temporary license only has 3 months valid period. This means if you didn't get your real driver license, your temporary license will expire and you have to go to DMV to renew temporary license. You can call DMV to track your application status. But as I said earlier, DMV works at the same speed of a turtle. You have to be very patient because wait time for most calls is around 30-40 minutes.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_6683.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_6683-e1527325962618-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DMV Office\" width=\"365\" height=\"486\" /></a>\n\nIn some instances, even if you are lucky to enough to talk to a DMV officer, they may forward to another phone number which deals with international student issues. So be patient again. Because wait time is still not less than 30 minutes.\n\nWhen you get your driver license, you can be disappointed because the expiration date of international student driver license is very limited. If you take a certificate program, your license will not be valid more than 1 year. If you are on OPT after your program, you may want to renew your driver license.\n<h2>Note for OPT Students</h2>\nOPT Students have different procedures for renewal. Because you are on OPT, you need to show your SSN and EAD Card (Work Permit Card) to DMV in order to renew your license. Otherwise, DMV will not approve your renewal.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, different states have different rules. What I have told so far is basically for students who are in California. For instance if you live in Pennsylvania, DMV will ask Social Security Number. If you are not eligible for a SSN yet, then you have to get a letter from the Social Security Office that says you are not eligible for SSN. This is not true for California.",

While United States has the biggest country in the world in terms of economy, military and so on, people really wonder \"Why is DMV so slow\"? DMV's cumbersome structure is  so notorious that even in some animation movies; DMV staff is pictured as <strong>\"Sloths\".</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0woPde7OE1k\n\nDMV is also notorious for its never ending lines outside of the DMV buildings. Ever one who lives in United States probably stood up in these long queues at least once. Needless to say that is a different type of government torture…\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1764\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2078\"]<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmvlines.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1764 size-full\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmvlines.jpg\" alt=\"Why is DMV so slow\" width=\"2078\" height=\"1002\" /></a> Source: Koreatimes.com[/caption]\n<h2>Why is DMV so slow?</h2>\nThere are several reasons for that. Here is a list of main reasons:\n<h3>Most people prefer to visit DMV instead of doing online.</h3>\nThis is one of the reasons why DMV offices are so busy and why is DMV so slow. While you can do many things online or by phone, some people to prefer to visit the office to be on safe side. But who can blame them? DMV's official website is really to complex and not user friendly. You have to be an expert to find what you are looking for. They might heard the complaints, recently they have updated DMV website.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1765\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1283\"]<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmv-website-new.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1765\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmv-website-new.jpg\" alt=\"why is dmv so slow\" width=\"1283\" height=\"913\" /></a> New look of DMV Website[/caption]\n\nThey even to start put some info-graphic for people who wants to get Real-ID. Check this one.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/realid-info-dmv.pdf\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1767 size-full\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/realid-info-dmv-pdf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1408\" height=\"1088\" /></a>\n\nDespite these efforts, website is still confusing after a second click. They have to update internal pages too. A cosmetic change on the main landing page is not enough. Maybe they have to allocate some money for marketing so that they can inform elderly people not to visit DMV office.\n<h3>People often bring missing documents</h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_596\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WhatsApp-Image-2017-10-13-at-15.44.12.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-596 size-large\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WhatsApp-Image-2017-10-13-at-15.44.12-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Why is DMV so slow\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" /></a> You can see document lists in every corner of DMV offices[/caption]\n\nThis is one of the other reasons why is DMV so slow. But who can blame people who bring wrong documents or wrong information. It is really find a proper information on DMV website even though you are an website expert. After waiting long hours in the lines, because of missing document, people can't complete their application. DMV can find a solution to check people's document while they are on the line. So if something is missing, people shouldn't wait in the line for nothing.\n<h3>Most offices do not have enough staff</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmv-office.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1769\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dmv-office.jpg\" alt=\"Why is DMV so slow\" width=\"1456\" height=\"944\" /></a>\n\nWhy is DMV so slow? Because many offices lack the personnel to quickly and efficiently handle large crowds. Is this DMV's fault or governments fault? There are elder people in the lines standing all day long. No one in the government ever see this scene. Or many counters are empty because maybe somebody is taking a vacation or calling in sick. Solution is to hire more people. What is the government doing with taxes?\n<h3>People who use DMV services increase every year</h3>\nIn most states, the majority of adults are licensed to drive and between new licenses, renewals, replacement licenses and testing nearly every adult in any given state goes through their office at least once every few years. In some cases people go to the offices every year.\n<h3>DMV staff is not friendly enough</h3>\nAgain who can blame them? This is a crappy job. Most of government jobs are low paying, high stress and have no promotion prospects. Also they give poor service because there is nothing to pressure them to give good service. Private sector salaries are much higher than government jobs. DMV can't afford to hire talented people and can't compete private sector. Maybe government should privatize DMV offices. Why not?",

      "content": "Safe driving is very important. It is needless to say that. I have had the experience of educating a number of individuals exactly how to drive. Some were youngsters, yet I have actually likewise instructed a few grownups exactly how to drive too. Allow's just say that I am more than pleased to have \"retired\" from this method as mentor someone exactly how to drive can be taxing mentally along with physically. Still, not everybody has the funds to visit driving school or a readily available friend to help out. So, if you are just one of the \"lucky\" ones playing the duty of instructor, below are some tips to assist keep you sane and also your trainee listening.\n<h2>Set A Schedule</h2>\nKeeping teens on a timetable can be nearly impossible as they manage their active lives with after college programs, work, research, interacting socially, and so on, however it is something that you should do. Find a time that benefits the both of you and also head out no greater than one hour each time for your lessons. Oh, incidentally, make certain your vehicle driver in training has his/her motorist's license on them in all times.\n<h2>Simple Begin.</h2>\nMaintain the very first lesson or more easy. Support in and out of the driveway and driving around the area initially are great begins. If you reside on a busy road, after that <i>you</i> need to drive the car to a less active area before enabling your student to take over. At the really starting, stay clear of driving on days when sidewalk is wet-- handling water when traveling is a different lesson for the extra seasoned student.\n\n<img src=\"https://pixabay.com/get/57e1d14a435bab14f6da8c7dda79347a1339dbe0504c704c7d2e7add974cc458_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" />\n<h2>An Excellent Start.</h2>\nThirty years after I first obtained my certificate, I keep in mind in my lessons being told that there were four points that a motorist should do prior to even beginning the auto: door, seat, seat belt, mirror. In other words: close as well as secure the doors, change the chauffeur's seat for your personal settings, secure your seat belt, and adjust side and also rear sight mirrors. After that, placed the key in the ignition, start the vehicle, look all over, involve the transmission, and slowly step on the accelerator and also obtain moving.\n<h2>Moving on.</h2>\nAs soon as your motorist has a good feel for the auto-- no jackrabbit begins or difficult breaking observed-- step points up and start practicing utilizing hand as well as directional signal, parallel parking, exactly how to bargain curbs as well as turns, and so on\n<h2>Marching.</h2>\nAfter a number of lessons of driving locally and exercising risk-free chauffeur behaviors, it is time to take the trainee out onto a busy roadway. Maintain this lesson brief to allow the worried student time to adapt to driving in web traffic. A minimum of originally prevent rush hour website traffic, highways, and areas with extreme pedestrian website traffic. Make sure your student comprehends roadway indications, traffic signals, stopping/yielding, and the myriad of other rules of the road. Repeat lessons as required to help your trainee grow accustomed to driving in website traffic. Once your pupil develops their confidence, take them out on the freeway.\n\n<img src=\"https://pixabay.com/get/57e2d54a4f56ab14f6da8c7dda79347a1339dbe0504c704c7d2e7add974cc458_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnqOmbR2qNs?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h2>Research as well as Evaluation.</h2>\nWhile behind the wheel lessons are exceptionally crucial, knowledge concerning driving laws as well as regulations are essential too. When driving later on, mention road signs and ask your student what they mean. Review the fines and points that can be examined by the Department of Electric Motor Cars for infractions. All of these things will be on their written examination.\n<h2>Defensive Driving.</h2>\nLearning just how to drive on ice and also snow is essential to being a safe vehicle driver if you live in a more northerly climate. Even if your student finds out exactly how to drive and also safeguards their permit in warmer months, insist on coming back in the vehicle with them when wet fallen leaves, snow, and also ice get on the ground. Also ensure that your pupil comprehends exactly how alcohol can hinder judgment, just how a radio, cell phone, or various other guests can sidetrack them, and also exactly how to drive around pedestrians, bicyclists, mopeds, etc.\n<h2>Inspect Liquids.</h2>\nA crucial lesson in addition to real driving as well as preparing for the composed test is maintenance of the automobile. Your pupil needs to know with looking under the hood, inspecting fluid levels, hoses, belts, and so on. Also reveal your student just how to check tire pressure, do a visual check of directional signal, fronts lights, and all various other lights. Familiarization with the exhaust as well as suspension systems is essential also.\n\n<img src=\"https://pixabay.com/get/55e6d4414e55a814f6da8c7dda79347a1339dbe0504c704c7d2e7add974cc458_640.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" />\n<h2>All set, Establish, Evaluate!</h2>\nWhen you are particular that your student recognizes all the rules of the road, is exhibiting risk-free driving practices, and is a positive motorist after that take the examination. Do not allow a pending birthday or special occasion drive that decision as you want to create a safe motorist, not a negligent one.\n\nOnce your pupil has actually passed their test make sure that the details on their permit is appropriate, your vehicle's enrollment is up to date, your insurance coverage has them covered, and the cars and truck that he will be driving is roadway ready prior to permitting him to drive by himself.\n\nBear in mind, driving is a benefit as well as not a right. Great driving practices are formed early, however so are bad habits. Nip any type of issues in the bud early to make certain the safety of your student and also everybody else that is out on our roads.",

If it feels like you need one, stop and stretch out your arms or take some deep breaths. You'll feel less stressed if you know it's okay to slow down every once in a while.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Take breaks during your behind-the-wheel lessons: stretch after 15 minutes of sitting still; drink water often enough without feeling like there's no end to your thirst, and take a break to stretch every hour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Practice Parallel Parking</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Use parking lots near where you live instead of general parking lots if you're not used to parallel parking. Because you have to practice a lot. Practice parallel parking over and over again. You might not think that this is necessary, but it's one of the most common things drivers are asked to do on their test--and you don't want to fail because you didn't learn how or had difficulty doing so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Use Both Hands While Driving</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Practice with both hands when turning the wheel.

The more time that passes before your test date, the less anxious and stressed out you'll feel about everything because driving will become second nature to you as long as you keep practicing every day or so (or even once a week) for at least an hour each session.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Practice Using The Turn Signals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Practice using the turn signals for more than just changing lanes: use them when you're turning at an intersection or even if you want to merge on the freeway, too. Don't turn right without signaling first; it's illegal unless there is no other option than turning at an intersection with two or more lanes. This way drivers are aware of your intent before they move into your lane from their/your side (or vice versa).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Open Your Eyes For Blind Spots</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Learn about things like blind spots before going out in public so that you can be aware of what's around your car while driving. For instance, know where people might stand or walk near a parking lot exit (especially children) and avoid those areas because they could easily get hit by someone exiting their vehicle from behind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Control Your Anger</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Know how to handle being cut off or blocked on the road without getting angry. You never know who this person is--it might not have been intentional--so keeping your tensin in control is very important.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Stop Signs Are Very Important</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If there is a stop sign in front of an intersection and traffic isn't coming from the other direction, make sure your foot remains on the brake pedal while stopped at the red light (don't just remove your foot). This way if someone does come from behind they'll know you're stopping and will be able to safely follow suit without running into your vehicle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Always Be Cautious</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Never assume what kind of driver is approaching you; always signal early enough before making your move. If you see a pedestrian in the street, slow down and be as cautious as possible to not hit them. When making a left-hand turn don't just put on your blinker--signal all around so that pedestrians know what you're doing. It's important for everyone's safety! If you get stuck waiting for someone who doesn't seem like they'll go ahead any time soon, then make sure to signal one last time to let them know you're waiting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Never Use Your Phone While Driving</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2264,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"media\",\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/the-man-uses-phone-in-the-car_t20_K6J3BK.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/the-man-uses-phone-in-the-car_t20_K6J3BK.jpg\" alt=\"Behind-the-wheel test \" class=\"wp-image-2264\"/></a></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>Don't use your phone while driving, even if it is hands-free. It is illegal and too distracting. In California, there are a lot of laws about using a cell phone while driving. One law says drivers under 18 years old cannot use their hands-free phones. Another law bans texting and other wireless devices use while driving. You can read more about these laws in this <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/cell-phones-driving-california-law-29709.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<h2>Beware Of Emergency Situations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"kioblocks\":[]} -->\n<p>If there is a line and someone has left their car in front of the space so that no one else can park there--don't do anything to them! It could be an emergency situation or they may have forgotten something inside. Just wait patiently for them to come back out. If possible, pull up behind the driver who is already parked with his/her blinker on to signal others not to take this spot as well. This will ensure everyone gets home safely every day without any trouble at all. If there isn't another parking spot available nearby--just hang tight until somebody leaves the spot for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

On the test day, an examiner will carry a Performance Evaluation Score Sheet and will tick marks on this sheet before and after your evaluation.

Here are practical tips to help you stay safe:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"decimal\"} -->\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Stay Alert</strong>: High winds increase the likelihood of debris on the road. Branches, signs, or even construction cones can be swept onto highways. You have to stay alert while driving.<img class=\"wp-image-2317\" style=\"width: 800px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom: 10px\" src=\"https://www.dmvcalifornia.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/terrified-stressful-traffic-driving-emotion-fear-stress-concerned-anxious-anxiety-rental-surprised_t20_vLAoG6.jpg\" alt=\"How To Drive In Santa Ana Winds\"></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Drive Steadily</strong>: Hold firmly on the wheel to control sudden gusts. Strong side winds, as shared in “Santa Ana winds today,” can unexpectedly push vehicles out of lanes, especially smaller cars or motorcycles. Even if your vehicle is not gone, you can still feel the strong gusts shaking your car, which may create some distraction. Driving steadily is the key in these situations. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Adjust Speed</strong>: High-speed driving in windy conditions is dangerous. Slowing down improves control and gives you more reaction time if you encounter other drivers struggling with gusts. But watch other vehicles behind and in front of you. Not everyone may adjust their speed. Check your rear or side mirrors as well. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Mind Larger Vehicles</strong>: Trucks and buses face additional challenges in high winds and may swerve unexpectedly. Giving them extra space is essential for your safety and theirs. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Avoid High-Profile Vehicles</strong>: Be extra cautious when driving a truck, van, or SUV, as these are more affected by crosswinds. These vehicles may also carry loads that spill or scatter because of the powerful Santa Ana Winds. It is best not to drive too closely to this kind of vehicle. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Watch for Dust</strong>: Santa Ana winds can kick up dust storms, impairing visibility. Use headlights and keep your distance. Especially during sunset or sunrise, you may have difficulty seeing your surroundings because the light is dim. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Stay in the Right Lane</strong>: If the wind is strong, staying in the right lane reduces the risk of faster, larger vehicles passing. It is better to avoid sharp lane changes during the strong winds. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Reduce Distractions</strong>: Focus solely on driving. Winds can require sudden adjustments that demand full attention.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Keep an Eye on Weather Alerts</strong>: Track wind speeds using weather apps or online resources for updates on “Santa Ana winds today.” Make it a habit to check the traffic before driving. It is also good to check Google or Apple Maps to see traffic at your destination because of the Santa Ana Winds. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Pull Over if Needed</strong>: If gusts are too strong, it’s safest to pull over and wait until conditions improve.
